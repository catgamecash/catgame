# $CHEESE

Only a maximum of six days in total can be pledged for the production of $CHEESE.

After six days have elapsed since the first NFT was pledged, or after all NFTs have been minted, staking will no longer produce $CHEESE.

At the same time, CheeSwap will be opened. You will be able to exchange your proceeds of $CHEESE for $BNB at a stable price at any time to leave the game. Or, if you want to participate in our phase1 game or participate in the governance of CatDAO later, you can choose to buy more $CHEESE at this time.

(For more information on the mechanism of CheeSwap, see appendix)

After CheeSwap ends, we will open the secondary market for trading.
