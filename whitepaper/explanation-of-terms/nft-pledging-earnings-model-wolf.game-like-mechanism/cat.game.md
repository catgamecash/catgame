# Cat.game

Cats and mice, competing for cheese in the house of the meta-universe. The mice have worked hard to collect the cheese, and the cats are eyeing the mice's results. Will the mice hand over some of the cheese to the cat for safety, or will they take a chance and risk losing everything to take all the cheese with them?

More mice want to come and harvest the cheese, but the cat won't waste this opportunity to catch them to make these mice work for themselves.
