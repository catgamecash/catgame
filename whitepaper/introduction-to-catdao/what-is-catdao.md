# What is CatDAO?

CatDAO will be a DAO launched through IGO (Initial Game Offering). We see the long-term value of the new NFTs and token gaming. CatDAO has the potential to be a long-term, exciting and sustainable model for P2E games.

CatDAO is initiated by the first phase of Catgame and all incoming $BNB lockups are used as CatDAO Treasury. DAO members will decide the direction and long-term design of the later game.

Our vision is to create a series of on-chain sustainable games with value anchors. This will be a playing field with fair redistribution of wealth, where players rely on interpreting the rules of each stage of the game to make the right decisions, each of which will guide the flow of wealth. Players no longer have to worry about risk from outside the field, and participate fully in the game. This essentially sets us apart from all previous Rug\&Run games.
