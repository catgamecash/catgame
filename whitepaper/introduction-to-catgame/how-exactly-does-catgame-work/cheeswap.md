# CheeSwap

CheeSwap is a stable swap, users can swap $CHEESE that they gain from pledging NFTs at a constant exchange rate into $BNB. Meanwhile, we welcome users to buy $CHEESE in CheeSwap, but the purchase price of $CHEESE will be higher than the sell price of $CHEESE, as to protect the earnings of our NFT users (i.e. NFT users have the lowest cost of $CHEESE in the world).

Our NFT will be purchased by $BNB throughout. All $BNB from the sale of NFT, except for 20% which will go to the team, will enter CatDAO Treasury as a guarantee for CatDAO's subsequent development.

Later in Phase 1 we will go live with CheeSwap, which will offer $CHEESE-$BNB pairs with stable exchange rates.

$CHEESE, as our key governance token in the later stages, will never be issued in increments and has a constant limited amount. As the launching phase, we do not want its price to be influenced by the secondary market and cause drastic ups and downs. This will affect the positive development of the CatDAO community.

Thanks to CheeSwap, you will be able to take profit or purchase $CHEESE at any time to participate in our later CatDAO governance .
