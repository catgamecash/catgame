# Smart Mint + Staking: Pledged late? You still have maximum gain!

In our mechanism design, whitelisted users' earnings will be guaranteed by the algorithm, but missing the earliest entry does not mean you will suffer losses.

In traditional projects, the latecomers will pay a significant profit for the earlier, so that for most people it will be a mere race of time, and whoever gets the news first will have the possibility to make a huge profit, which is very unfair for the later. (It is clear that many people are joining the game at the same time, but due to the sequence, their profit situation will incur huge difference.)

But in Catgame, we add a prediction mechanism for Mint progress, and there will be a mechanism to reward later comers. We link everyone's profit to the outcome of the game on Mint progress. So, it is still possible for the latecomers to make a profit before the outcome of the game is known.

As an example: in the case of incomplete Mint progress, the last 1000 comers can get a maximum return on investment of more than 300% return on investment and all your $CHEESE are backed by $BNB in the Treasury, they can be redeemed at a stable rate.

If you miss the opportunity to become an early pledger, you will have the opportunity to maximize your return by making the right prediction of our Mint progress.

We will **send airdrops** to addresses that minted NFTs after the Mint progress cutoffs. The Mint and Pledge **cutoffs** can be triggered by the occurrence of any of the following.



1. If players can't mint all the NFTs for a period of time, Mint will be forcibly closed when the maximum number of days - 6 days is reached
2. the number of Mint reaches the maximum number

The distribution of air drops will also vary depending on how the game is triggered by the cutoff

&#x20;

1. If you fail to mint all the NFTs, the last 1000 players who successfully minted before the cutoff will receive 75% of our airdrop.
2. If the number of mint reaches the maximum number: 80% of players in the middle will get 90% of the airdrop.

**We will airdrop at least as many tokens as the total pledged output tokens, and in extreme cases, we will airdrop ten times as many tokens as the pledged output tokens.**

* If you need to see detailed airdrop and pledge data, see appendix

Simply put, if you make the right decision, you have the chance to be the richest gainer in the house at any time in our games.
