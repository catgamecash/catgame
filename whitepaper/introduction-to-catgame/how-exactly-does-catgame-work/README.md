# How exactly does Catgame work?

Catgame is an interactive protocol based on BSC's NFTs and tokens. You will be able to buy NFTs with $BNB and subsequently pledge them to produce $CHEESE.

All $BNB collected from selling NFTs will be deposited in CatDAO Treasury and you will be able to sell your $CHEESE at a constant price at any time during the game to gain profits.
