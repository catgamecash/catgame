# Our innovation



We will emphasize this part.

In the accustomed mechanism of all previous tokens or NFTs, it is predetermined that users who entered the project late would receive minimal expected returns. As every participants are expected to be our DAO member, we don't want that. We want you to be able to **profit** by making the right decisions **at all times**. Therefore, we propose the complete process of Initial Game Offering (IGO): Smart Mint + CheeSwap + CaDAO. In addition to the innovation in the Minting mechanism, we also creatively propose: CheeSwap, which guarantees that everyone who participates in the Mint process is protected by smart contracts from secondary market speculators. Finally, with Cat DAO, we guarantee that all processes are executed by smart contracts and 80% of the Mint sale will be injected into CatDAO Treasury, guaranteeing that every $CHEESE is backed by cash.

With IGO, a community is able to fair launch a token and membership through a GameFi for the first time. This purely on-chain fundraising approach will promise the community a "neutral fund" and first users and DAO members right after it launches.
