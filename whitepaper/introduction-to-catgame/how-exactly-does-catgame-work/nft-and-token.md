# NFT\&Token

For the NFT and token interaction mechanism, we will use a wolf.game-like mechanism. You will have a chance to mint two types of NFTs:

* Mouse: Pledge to produce $CHEESE
* Cat: Pledge to steal the $CHEESE from the mouse or steal the newborn NFT (cat and mouse) directly

If you are not familiar with the wolf.game-like mechanism or you want to learn more about the details, please move on to NFT Pledging Earnings

Note: We will be offering NFTs of "Cat" and "Mouse" at phase0. NFT holders will be considered as core members of CatDAO and will be involved in more subsequent projects and decision making.

* NFT Pledging Earnings: (wolf.game-like mechanism) See appendix

Beyond the mechanism, it's all about our innovation:
