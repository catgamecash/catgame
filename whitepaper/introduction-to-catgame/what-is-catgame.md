# What is Catgame?



Catgame is the starter game of CatDAO, where you will acquire CatDAO's (See CatDAO) governing token, $CHEESE (See CHEESE), by pledging the NFTs we offer, and enjoy the benefits and surprises of the carefully designed game mechanics during the process.

All the $BNB earned from selling NFTs will be directly locked in the CatDAO Treasury (See CatDAO Treasury) through the smart contract and provide a stable $CHEESE-$BNB exchange through CatSwap, which will open in the later stage of the game. In other words, CatDAO will maintain a constant price for the tokens you get, so don't worry about the devaluation of $CHEESE until the secondary market opens.
