# Introduction to CatDAO

#### What is CatDAO?&#x20;

CatDAO will be a DAO launched through IGO (Initial Game Offering). We see the long-term value of the new NFTs and token gaming. CatDAO has the potential to be a long-term, exciting and sustainable model for P2E games.

CatDAO is initiated by the first phase of Catgame and all incoming $ETH lockups are used as CatDAO Treasury. DAO members will decide the direction and long-term design of the later game.

Our vision is to create a series of on-chain sustainable games with value anchors. This will be a playing field with fair redistribution of wealth, where players rely on interpreting the rules of each stage of the game to make the right decisions, each of which will guide the flow of wealth. Players no longer have to worry about risk from outside the field, and participate fully in the game. This essentially sets us apart from all previous Rug\&Run games.

#### What is the point of CatDAO?&#x20;

CatDAO is committed to creating a series of sustainable on-chain games based on game theory.

Such a game is based on our governance tokens, NFTs and carefully designed game mechanism that allow everyone to maximize their earnings by making the right choices and, of course, you will pay for the wrong ones.

Outside of the game, CatDAO will use the power of DAO and CatDAO Treasury to back the game with real value. We want every participant to focus on their investment choices during the game. Be assured: you will be able to take your profits and your losses will be physically presented.

The potential of CatDAO is infinite, and the core members of CatDAO will make decisions about where to direct CatDAO's power and financial resources. We look forward to the future of CatDAO and the CatDAO Treasury empowered community.

#### How do I participate in CatDAO?&#x20;

We welcome all members to participate in our community activities at every stage of our game.

Moreover, if you own the NFT we offer, you will be considered as a core member of CatDAO. Core members will participate in CatDAO internal activities and have more choices and opportunities to participate in projects.

We will release "Mouse" and "Cat" NFTs in our phase0.
