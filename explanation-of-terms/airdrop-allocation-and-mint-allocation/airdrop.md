# Airdrop

**Airdrop**

The total $CHEESE output of the game and airdrop is 1 billion, meaning that if the output of pledging is more, the number of airdrops will be less, and vice versa.

**Interpretation for Airdrop Shares**

If only 1,000 people complete the mint, the maximum number of tokens produced in six days is 60 million, then there will be an airdrop of 940 million tokens. Meaning that if the number of participants is too small, then the amount generated through their pledges will be small as well. Thus, early participants will have little advantage and their pledge rewards, compared to rewards from airdrops, will be dominated. If there is an average of 7,000 individuals producing an average of 10,000 $CHEESE per day for 4 days (cats don't produce $CHEESE, so the real average output will be a little less than 10,000), there will be 280 million produced, then there will be an airdrop of 420 million tokens and the pledged rewards will be able to compete with the tokens given out by the airdrop.

The number of $CHEESE generated by airdrops is bound to be greater than the number of pledged outputs.

We can ensure a steady redistribution of resources only if the number of $CHEESE from airdrops can dominate.

To a certain degree, it also means that we not only build a game using Wolfgame mechanism, but also a game designed on minting progress. You can play a second game on the choice of minting progress.
