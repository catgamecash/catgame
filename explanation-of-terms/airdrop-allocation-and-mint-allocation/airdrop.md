# Airdrop

**Airdrop Shares**

The maximum $CHEESE generated from games and airdrops is 700 million. Under the most ideal scenario, staking will produce 510 million $CHEESE and airdrops will produce 190 million. The ratio between staking and airdrops is therefore 5.1:1.9. Under any other scenarios, we will also use the 5.1:1.9 ratio to decide the amount for airdrops.

To a certain degree, it also means that we not only build a game using Wolfgame mechanism, but also a game designed on minting progress. You can play a second game on deciding when to participate.
