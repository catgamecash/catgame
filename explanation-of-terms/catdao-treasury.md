# CatDAO Treasury

Whenever a NFT is minted, 80% of the $ETH will be locked in a public vault, and the remaining 20% will be used for the team's subsequent development and implementation of the subsequent roadmap project.

We will also open a carefully designed CheeSwap to ensure that every $CHEESE can be exchanged consistently before it is put on the secondary market, providing liquidity and allowing our players to exchange their $CHEESE freely.
