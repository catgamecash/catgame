# NFT Staking Earnings Model

### Cat.game

Cats and mice, competing for cheese in the house of the meta-universe. The mice have worked hard to collect the cheese, and the cats are eyeing the mice's results. Will the mice hand over some of the cheese to the cat for safety, or will they take a chance and risk losing everything to take all the cheese with them?

More mice want to come and harvest the cheese, but the cat won't waste this opportunity to catch them to make these mice work for themselves.

#### Definition

The cat game aims to create an iterable, large-scale METAVERSE playground using well-designed economical model and novel tokenomics.

You get to decide how to interact with the community using your NFTs and $CHEESE Tokens and all the profit or responsibilities are your own.

#### Quick Guide

Stage 1:

* NFT: phase0 has and only has 10,000 NFTs that can be purchased at a stepped price before the end of phase0.
* Mouse Staking: You can stake Mouse to get $CHEESE tokens. You can claim to get 80% of the $CHEESE you have earned, or take a 50% chance to unstake with the risk of all $CHEESE being stolen by cats.
* NFT Stealing Mechanism: If you want to bring a new mouse into the house, the cats will try their best to catch our new guy - and when they succeed, they will give it to a randomly chosen Cat NFT holder instead of the owner who initially minted it.

| Mint a new mouse | There is a 10% chance that the NFT is actually a Cat! | 10% chance of the new Cat or Mouse being stolen by a staked Cat. Each Cat's chance of success is proportional to their Skill Level. |

80% of the $BNB spent on Mint will go to CatDAO Treasury to provide value anchoring and the remaining 20% will go to the development team.

#### Mouse

You have a 90% chance of minting a Mouse and they all have unique characteristics. They can do:

| Action        | Notes                                                                                                                                | Risk                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Stake         | Find 10,000 $CHEESE / day(prorated to the second)                                                                                    | No Risk                                                                                                                                                              |
| Claim $CHEESE | Receive 80% of $CHEESE accumulated                                                                                                   | Cat take 20% CHEESE away. CHEESE taken is split among all the Cat currently staked. Proportional to their Alpha scores.                                              |
| Unstake       | Mouse is removed and all $CHEESE is shorn. Can only be done if the Mouse has accumulated 2 days worth of $CHEESE, to not to starve . | 50% chance of ALL of your accumulated $CHEESE being stolen by Cats. Stolen $CHEESE is split among all the Cats currently staked, proportional to their Skill levels. |

#### $CHEESE

Only a maximum of six days in total can be staked for the production of $CHEESE.

After six days have elapsed since the first NFT was staked, or after all NFTs have been minted, staking will no longer produce $CHEESE.

At the same time, CheeSwap will be opened. You will be able to exchange your proceeds of $CHEESE for $BNB at a stable price at any time to leave the game. Or, if you want to participate in our phase1 game or participate in the governance of CatDAO later, you can choose to buy more $CHEESE at this time.

(For more information on the mechanism of CheeSwap, see appendix)

After CheeSwap ends, we will open the secondary market for trading.

#### Cats

You have a 10% chance of minting a Cat and they all have unique characteristics and Skill Levels.

The higher Skill Levels indicats:

* Higher portion of $CHEESE that cat earns from harrassing mice taking CHEESE back to the Hole.
* Higher chance of catching a newly minted Cat or Mouse.

They can do:

| Action        | Notes                                                            | Risk     |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Stake         | Earn your share of the 20% tax of all $CHEESE generated by Mouse | No Risk  |
| Claim $CHEESE | Receive all $CHEESE taxes accrued for the staked Cat             | No Risk. |
| Unstake       | Receive all $CHEESe taxes accrued for the staked Cat             | No Risk. |

#### Conclusion:

In this part we designed the game interaction between NFTs and tokens. The game mechanism gives you a lot of choices, you can choose for yourself between risk and peace of mind, high yield and stable income.
