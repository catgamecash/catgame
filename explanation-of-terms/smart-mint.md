# Smart-Mint

There are 2 different scenarios:

****

**When NFTs minted < 10,000**

When minting is incomplete, the last 1,000 participants will get 75% of airdrops and others share the remaining 25%.

However, such mechanism will bring losses to early players; we donâ€™t want to disappoint our early supporters. Suppose there are 2,000 NFTs minted, the first 1,000 will share 25% of airdrops while the last 1,000 will share 75%. It looks like the early participants have failed, but is that really the case? In fact, everything can be reversed in a heartbeat.

We have designed the following mechanism.                                 &#x20;

**When NFTs minted = 10,000**

If all 10,000 NFTs are minted, then the middle 80% (i.e., 1000-9000 users) will get 90% of the remaining airdrops, and the rest will be shared equally.

This means that 80% of the participants will share 90%. Because of the mint cost discount and staking earnings, the first 1,000 participants already take advantages. So, they share 5% and the last 1,000 players share the remaining 5%.
