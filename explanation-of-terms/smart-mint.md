# Smart-Mint

There are 2 different scenarios:

### **1.When NFTs minted < 10,000**

When minting is incomplete, the last 1,000 participants will get 75% of airdrops and others share the 25%.

Note: Cat DAO membership (i.e., NFT) itself comes with its own value, we default 20% minting cost equals the value of NFTs.

However, such a mechanism will bring losses to early players; we don’t want to disappoint our early supporters. In the data we've listed above, 1,000 players have participated in the game. Once the last 1,000 finish the mint, the total at the end of the mint will be over 2,000, so the last 1,000 start profiting. It looks like the early participants have failed, but is that really the case? In fact, everything can be reversed in a heartbeat.

So, we have designed the following mechanism.

&#x20;

### **2. When NFTs minted = 10,000**

If all 10,000 are minted, then the middle 80% (i.e., 0-8000 users) will get 90% of the remaining airdrops, and the rest will be shared equally.

This means that 80% of the participants will share 90%. Because of the mint cost discount and pledged earnings, the first 1,000 participants already take advantage. So, they share 5%.

### **Conclusion**

With the above mechanisms, you can't lose money if you continue to be a part of the last 1,000 while mint is incomplete at the end.

And once the number passes 4,000, everyone will have “resurrection” rights. Because a person can be dumped from the queue only once, and the probability of minting cats get higher, minting will get easier.

Then the more you get to the back, in fact, the easier it is to mint 1,000 NFTs because the final gain is just too big.

As we have already mentioned, ultimately, most people are not the last 1,000 places. So, within this large interval, you can mint many times, and the number of times you mint not only helps the game reduce the difficulty of minting, but also makes it easier to reach 10,000. The earlier you mint the bigger the gain, and it can accommodate more of your principal.

By now, perhaps you have a preliminary understanding.

You will also understand what the first edition of our white paper emphasizes: we originated from Wolfgame.

We are an innovative game theory game; we are not gambling and do not rely on luck.

Our rules of the game serve the person who interprets them correctly and who can make money if he is able to do so.

We have set up smart contracts to ensure that everything will go as planned.

That's why we put so much emphasis on community education.

Because we need you to carefully understand the rules of the game and then make your choice!

Good luck！
