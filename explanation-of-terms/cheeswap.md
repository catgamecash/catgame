# CheeSwap

Why create CheeSwap:

We have observed that many speculators hoard a lot of tokens needed for the game before the game starts, and when the game is launched, they sell off a lot of them, causing a bad experience for the real players and becoming a serious resistance to the rise of tokens. We specially opened a CheeSwap to generate a stable price of cheeses to prevent speculators from manipulating the price outside the secondary market, and to make the game launch as fair as possible.

We will guarantee everyone's rights and security, our CheeSwap and smart contracts are audited by professionals to ensure you can have a safe world in CatDAO.

Specific mechanisms:

We will calculate the intrinsic value of each $CHEESE.

**Intrinsic value = total amount of $ETH in the treasury / total amount of $CHEESE in circulation**

In CheeSwap, you can sell your $CHEESE at 95% of its intrinsic value in exchange for its corresponding $ETH, or you can buy $CHEESE at 50% above its intrinsic value, and the sold $CHEESE will be stored in swap for others to buy.

This means that whether you buy or sell, we increase the intrinsic value of each $CHEESE, so you have a chance to get $CHEESE at a very low price, regardless of whether you win the first phase of the game or not. The sale of $CHEESE by others during the swap does not result in a loss of interest for you, rather the sale by others will increase the value of your $CHEESE.

CheeSwap will continue for some time until everyone has made a decision completely, after which the secondary market LP will be opened to facilitate the free exchange of $CHEESE.

In order to prevent the unlimited issuance of $CHEESE, CheeSwap has a total of 200 million $CHEESE available for exchange.

After CheeSwap is closed, $CHEESE that have not yet redeemed will be destroyed to ensure the value of the outstanding $CHEESE.

When everyone has sufficiently exchanged price and the first phase is over, everyone's assets are backed by $ETH as their intrinsic value. Theoretically, the maximum retraction for everyone after the LP opening has been fixed. We will work together with CatDAO members to keep creating new games in the blockchain world.
